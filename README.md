# PopularMovies
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
This app is free to use.
It is uploaded for the educational purpose. It is part of the Udacity nanodegree program.

NOTE: In order to work properly, please add your MovieDB api key to the values/strings.xml file.
