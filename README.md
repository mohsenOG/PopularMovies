# PopularMovies
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
This app is free to use but do not forget my credit :P.
It is uploaded for the educational purpose. It is part of the Udacity nanodegree program.

NOTE: In order to work properly, please add your MovieDB api key to gradle.properties file.

NOTE: It is good to use these features as well:
  - set the placeholder and error values  for picasson.
  Picasso.with(context)
    .load(url)
    .placeholder(R.drawable.user_placeholder)
    .error(R.drawable.user_placeholder_error)
    .into(imageView);
   
  - using styles to have general styles. They can be used to have a cleaner layout xml files without overdoing the same features.
